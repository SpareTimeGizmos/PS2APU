# PS2APU
This repository contains the source for the PS/2 Keyboard APU used by the Elf 2000, VIS1802 and VT1802 projects.  This firmware interfaces to a standard IBM PC PS/2 keyboard and produces a parallel ASCII output.  It needs to be compiled by SDCC and programmed into an AT89C4051 microcontroller.
